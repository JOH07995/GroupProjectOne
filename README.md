### Recipe Now!
 
 Project Description: 
 
 A no-nonsense application that returns a recipe to users based on their given search parameter.  We wanted to create a very streamlined  and straight forward website that preforms two different API calls and returns two sets of data that work together in the result.  
 
 ### User Story:
 
 A busy person that wants a quick recipe
 THAT CAN use an application or website 
 TO provide a quick recipe to make and eat

### Motivation:  
 
 The motivation for the development of this website is to help a person that’s feeling indecisive on what they want to eat when they’re back from work, event or school. If they have a certain ingredient such as chicken, a recipe will appear once they add their main ingredient.
